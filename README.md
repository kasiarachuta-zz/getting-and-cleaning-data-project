# getting-and-cleaning-data-project
This file contains the Getting And Cleaning Data Project for Week 4 to be peer-reviewed.<br>
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. <br>
<br>
This repo contains:<br>
a) a tidy dataset<br>
b) the script performing the analysis<br>
c) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.

This script should do the following activities - in 5 steps:<br>
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br>
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
