# getting-and-cleaning-data-project

This script should do the following activities - in 5 steps:<br>
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.<br>
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.<br>
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
